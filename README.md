# My-Investing-Experiments---Repo

**Intro:**

This repo was created specifically to include my trading experiments on various asset classes, as well as some financial models I have recently developed.  The material in this Repository is not for professional purposes, but is only meant to show some of my recent work. I also invite you to read the ReadMe file to get all the information.

**Repo Structure:**

The Repositoty contains two main folders: Financial Models (Excel based) and Trading Strategies (Python based). The former contains mainly fundamental analyses of public companies, the latter some of the most common statistical arbitrage, relative value and machine learning strategies on various asset classes such as: Equities, Commodities, FX and Indexes. The latter folder is divided into sub-folders according to the strategy applied and the asset class.

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this Repository is limited to showing and disclosing some of my recent experiments in trading and financial analysis. Anyone who accesses the link to this repository is free to view and re-use the code here. Furthermore, it has been specified for each file (see the last line) whether it was taken from other external sources and subsequently modified, or created entirely by me.  Finally, I again specify that the files in this repo do not have any professional use and do not represent investment advice.
